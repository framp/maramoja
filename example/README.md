##Temporary stuff (form support)
We're waiting for [this PR](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/pull/828) to be merged in react-router (which will be done probably after [1.0](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/pull/1158)) and for a fix for react-router-form.


After that, we won't need to replace react-router on the client and we'll be able to remove the git dependency on `framp/react-router-form`.
